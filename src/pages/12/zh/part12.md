<!-- In this part, we will learn how to package code into standard units of software called containers. These containers can help us develop software faster and easier than before. Along the way, we will also explore a completely new viewpoint for web development outside of the now-familiar Node.js backend and React frontend.-->
 在这部分中，我们将学习如何将代码打包成标准的软件单元，称为容器。这些容器可以帮助我们比以前更快、更容易地开发软件。在这一过程中，我们还将在现在熟悉的Node.js后端和React前端之外，探索一种全新的网络开发观点。

<!-- We will utilize containers to create immutable execution environments for our Node.js and React projects. Containers also make it easy to include multiple services with our projects. With the flexibility, we will explore and experiment with many different and popular tools by utilizing containers.-->
 我们将利用容器来为我们的Node.js和React项目创建不可改变的执行环境。容器还可以使我们的项目轻松地包含多种服务。有了这种灵活性，我们将通过利用容器来探索和尝试许多不同的流行工具。
