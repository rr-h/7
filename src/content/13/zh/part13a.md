 在本节中，我们将探讨使用关系型数据库的节点应用。在这一节中，我们将为第3-5节中熟悉的笔记应用建立一个使用关系数据库的节点后端。要完成这一部分，你需要对关系型数据库和SQL有合理的了解。有许多关于SQL数据库的在线课程，例如，[SQLbolt](https://sqlbolt.com/)和

### Advantages and disadvantages of document databases

<!-- We have used the MongoDB database in all the previous sections of the course. Mongo is a [document database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database) and one of its most characteristic features is that it is <i>schemaless</i>, i.e. the database has only a very limited awareness of what kind of data is stored in its collections. The schema of the database exists only in the program code, which interprets the data in a specific way, e.g. by identifying that some of the fields are references to objects in another collection.-->
 我们在本课程的所有前几部分都使用了MongoDB数据库。Mongo是一个[文档数据库](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database)，它的一个最大特点是它是<i>无模式的</i>，也就是说，数据库对其集合中存储了什么样的数据只有非常有限的认识。数据库的模式只存在于程序代码中，它以一种特定的方式解释数据，例如，通过识别一些字段是对另一个集合中的对象的引用。

<!-- In the example application of parts 3 and 4, the database stores notes and users.-->
 在第3和第4章节的应用实例中，数据库存储了笔记和用户。

<!-- A collection of <i>notes</i> that stores notes looks like the following:-->
一个存储笔记的<i>笔记</i>集合如下所示：下面这样。

```js
[
  {
    "_id": "600c0e410d10256466898a6c",
    "content": "HTML is easy"
    "date": 2021-01-23T11:53:37.292+00:00,
    "important": false
    "__v": 0
  },
  {
    "_id": "600c0edde86c7264ace9bb78",
    "content": "CSS is hard"
    "date": 2021-01-23T11:56:13.912+00:00,
    "important": true
    "__v": 0
  },
]
```

<!-- Users saved in the <i>users</i> collection looks like the following:-->
 保存在<i>users</i>集合中的用户如下所示：下面这样。

```js
[
  {
    "_id": "600c0e410d10256466883a6a",
    "username": "mluukkai",
    "name": "Matti Luukkainen",
    "passwordHash" : "$2b$10$Df1yYJRiQuu3Sr4tUrk.SerVz1JKtBHlBOARfY0PBn/Uo7qr8Ocou",
    "__v": 9,
    notes: [
      "600c0edde86c7264ace9bb78",
      "600c0e410d10256466898a6c"
    ]
  },
]
```

<!-- MongoDB does know the types of the fields of the stored entities, but it has no information about which collection of entities the user record ids are referring to. MongoDB also does not care what fields the entities stored in the collections have. Therefore MongoDB leaves it entirely up to the programmer to ensure that the correct information is being stored in the database.-->
 MongoDB确实知道存储实体的字段类型，但是它没有关于用户记录id指的是哪个实体集合的信息。MongoDB也不关心存储在集合中的实体有哪些字段。因此，MongoDB完全让程序员来确保正确的信息被存储在数据库中。

<!-- There are both advantages and disadvantages to not having a schema. One of the advantages is the flexibility that schema agnosticism brings: since the schema does not need to be defined at the database level, application development may be faster in certain cases, and easier, with less effort needed in defining and modifying the schema in any case. Problems with not having a schema are related to error-proneness: everything is left up to the programmer. The database itself has no way of checking whether the data in it is <i>honest</i>, i.e. whether all mandatory fields have values, whether the reference type fields refer to existing entities of the right type in general, etc.-->
 没有模式既有优点也有缺点。其中一个优点是模式无关性带来的灵活性：由于模式不需要在数据库级别上定义，所以在某些情况下，应用开发可能会更快，更容易，在任何情况下，定义和修改模式所需的努力都会减少。没有模式的问题与易错性有关：一切都由程序员决定。数据库本身没有办法检查其中的数据是否是<i>诚实的</i>，即是否所有的强制字段都有值，参考类型字段是否引用了一般正确类型的现有实体，等等。

<!-- The relational databases that are the focus of this section, on the other hand, lean heavily on the existence of a schema, and the advantages and disadvantages of schema databases are almost the opposite compared of the non-schema databases.-->
 本节重点讨论的关系型数据库，则在很大程度上依赖于模式的存在，与非模式型数据库相比，模式型数据库的优势和劣势几乎相反。

<!-- The reason why the the previous sections of the course used MongoDB is precisely because of its schema-less nature, which has made it easier to use the database for someone with little knowledge of relational databases. For most of the use cases of this course, I personally would have chosen to use a relational database.-->
 本课程的前几节之所以使用MongoDB，正是因为它的无模式特性，这使得对关系型数据库了解不多的人更容易使用该数据库。对于本课程的大部分用例，我个人会选择使用关系型数据库。

### Application database

<!-- For our application we need a relational database. There are many options, but we will be using the currently most popular Open Source solution [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). You can install Postgres (as the database is often called) on your machine, if you wish to do so. An easier option would be using Postgres as a cloud service, e.g. [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/). You could also take advantage of the course [rheumatology](/en/rheumatology) lessons and use Postgres locally using Docker.-->
对于我们的应用，我们需要一个关系型数据库。有很多选择，但我们将使用目前最流行的开源解决方案[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/）。如果你愿意的话，你可以在你的机器上安装Postgres（该数据库通常被称为)。一个更简单的选择是将Postgres作为云服务，例如[ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/)。你也可以利用课程[第12部分](/en/rheumatology)中的课程，使用Docker在本地使用Postgres。

<!-- However, we will be taking advantage of the fact that it is possible to create a Postgres database for the application on the Heroku cloud service platform, which is familiar from the parts 3 and 4.-->
 然而，我们将利用在Heroku云服务平台上为应用创建Postgres数据库的优势，这一点在第3和第4章节中已经很熟悉。

<!-- In the theory material of this section, we will be building a Postgres-enabled version from the backend of the notes-storage application, which was built in sections 3 and 4.-->
 在本节的理论材料中，我们将从第3和第4节中建立的笔记存储应用的后台建立一个支持Postgres的版本。

<!-- Now let's create a suitable directory inside the Heroku application, add a database to it and use the _heroku config_ command to get the <i>connect string</i>, which is required to connect to the database:-->
 现在让我们在Heroku应用中创建一个合适的目录，在其中添加一个数据库，并使用_heroku config_命令来获得<i>连接字符串</i>，这是连接数据库所需要的。

```bash
heroku create
# Returns an app-name for the app you just created in heroku.

heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev -a <app-name>
heroku config -a <app-name>
=== cryptic-everglades-76708 Config Vars
DATABASE_URL: postgres://<username>:thepasswordishere@<host-of-postgres-addon>:5432/<db-name>
```

<!-- Particularly when using a relational database, it is essential to access the database directly as well. There are many ways to do this, there are several different graphical user interfaces, such as [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/). However, we will be using Postgres [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) command-line tool.-->
 特别是在使用关系型数据库时，直接访问数据库也是非常必要的。有很多方法可以做到这一点，有几个不同的图形用户界面，如[pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)。然而，我们将使用Postgres [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html)命令行工具。

<!-- The database can be accessed by running _psql_ command on the Heroku server as follows (note that the command parameters depend on the connection url of the Heroku database):-->
 通过在Heroku服务器上运行_psql_命令可以访问数据库，如下所示（注意，命令参数取决于Heroku数据库的连接网址）。

```bash
heroku run psql -h <host-of-postgres-addon> -p 5432 -U <username> <dbname> -a <app-name>
```

<!-- After entering the password, let's try the main psql command _\d_, which tells you the contents of the database:-->
 输入密码后，让我们试试主要的psql命令_d_，它告诉你数据库的内容。

```bash
Password for user <username>:
psql (13.4 (Ubuntu 13.4-1.pgdg20.04+1))
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# \d
Did not find any relations.
```

<!-- As you might guess, there is currently nothing in the database.-->
 正如你可能猜到的，目前数据库中没有任何东西。

<!-- Let's create a table for notes:-->
 让我们为笔记创建一个表。

```sql
CREATE TABLE notes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    content text NOT NULL,
    important boolean,
    date time
);
```

<!-- A few points: column <i>id</i> is defined as a <i>primary key</i>, which means the value of the column must be unique for each row in the table and the value must not be empty. The type for this column is defined as [SERIAL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-SERIAL), which is not the actual type but an abbreviation for an integer column to which Postgres automatically assigns a unique, increasing value when creating rows. The column named <i>content</i> with type text is defined in such a way that it must be assigned a value.-->
 几点：列<i>id</i>被定义为<i>主键</i>，这意味着该列的值对于表中的每一行都必须是唯一的，并且该值不能为空。这个列的类型被定义为[SERIAL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-SERIAL)，这不是实际的类型，而是一个整数列的缩写，Postgres在创建行的时候会自动分配一个唯一的、增加的值。类型为text的名为<i>content</i>的列是这样定义的，它必须被分配一个值。

<!-- Let's look at the situation from the console. First, the _\d_ command, which tells us what tables are in the database:-->
 让我们从控制台看一下这个情况。首先，_d_命令，它告诉我们数据库中有哪些表。

```sql
postgres=# \d
                 List of relations
 Schema | Name | Type | Owner
--------+--------------+----------+----------------
 public | notes | table | username
 public | notes_id_seq | sequence | username
(2 rows)
```

In addition to the <i>notes</i> table, Postgres created a subtable called <i>notes\_id\_seq</i>, which keeps track of what value is assigned to the <i>id</i> column when creating the next note.

With the command _\d notes_, we can see how the <i>notes</i> table is defined:

```sql
postgres=# \d notes;
                                     Table "public.notes"
  Column | Type | Collation | Nullable | Default
-----------+------------------------+-----------+----------+-----------------------------------
 id | integer | not null | nextval('notes_id_seq'::regclass)
 content | text | | not null |
 important | boolean | | | |
 date | time without time zone | | | |
Indexes:
    "notes_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
```

<!-- Therefore the column <i>id</i> has a default value, which is obtained by calling the internal function of Postgres <i>nextval</i>.-->
 因此列<i>id</i>有一个默认值，它是通过调用Postgres的内部函数<i>nextval</i>获得的。

<!-- Let's add some content to the table:-->
 让我们在表中添加一些内容。

```sql
insert into notes (content, important) values ('Relational databases rule the world', true);
insert into notes (content, important) values ('MongoDB is webscale', false);
```

<!-- And let's see what the created content looks like:-->
 让我们看看创建的内容是什么样子的。

```sql
postgres=# select * from notes;
 id | content | important | date
----+-------------------------------------+-----------+------
  1 | relational databases rule the world | t |
  2 | MongoDB is webscale | f |
(2 rows)
```

If we try to store data in the database that is not according to the schema, it will not succeed. The value of a mandatory column cannot be missing:

```sql
postgres=# insert into notes (important) values (true);
ERROR: null value in column "content" of relation "notes" violates not-null constraint
DETAIL: Failing row contains (9, null, t, null).
```

The column value cannot be of the wrong type:

```sql
postgres=# insert into notes (content, important) values ('only valid data can be saved', 1);
ERROR: column "important" is of type boolean but expression is of type integer
LINE 1: ...tent, important) values ('only valid data can be saved', 1); ^
```

Columns that don't exist in the schema are not accepted either:

```sql
postgres=# insert into notes (content, important, value) values ('only valid data can be saved', true, 10);
ERROR: column "value" of relation "notes" does not exist
LINE 1: insert into notes (content, important, value) values ('only ...
```

Next it's time to move on to accessing the database from the application.

### Node application using a relational database

Let's start the application as usual with the <i>npm init</i> and install <i>nodemon</i> as a development dependency and also the following runtime dependencies:

```bash
npm install express dotenv pg sequelize
```

Of these, the latter [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/master/) is the library through which we use Postgres. Sequelize is a so-called [Object relational mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping) (ORM) library that allows you to store JavaScript objects in a relational database without using the SQL language itself, similar to Mongoose that we used with MongoDB.

Let's test that we can connect successfully. Create the file <i>index.js</i> and add the following content:

```js
require('dotenv').config()
const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize')

const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE_URL, {
  dialectOptions: {
    ssl: {
      require: true,
      rejectUnauthorized: false
    }
  },
})

const main = async () => {
  try {
    await sequelize.authenticate()
    console.log('Connection has been established successfully.')
    sequelize.close()
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Unable to connect to the database:', error)
  }
}

main()
```

The database <i>connect string</i>, which is revealed by the _heroku config_ command should be stored in a <i>.env</i> file, the contents should be something like the following:

```bash
$ cat .env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://<username>:thepasswordishere@ec2-54-83-137-206.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/<databasename>
```

Let's test for a successful connection:

```bash
$ node index.js
Executing (default): SELECT 1+1 AS result
Connection has been established successfully.
```

If and when the connection works, we can then run the first query. Let's modify the program as follows:

```js
require('dotenv').config()
const { Sequelize, QueryTypes } = require('sequelize') // highlight-line

const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE_URL, {
  dialectOptions: {
    ssl: {
      require: true,
      rejectUnauthorized: false
    }
  },
});

const main = async () => {
  try {
    await sequelize.authenticate()
    // highlight-start
    const notes = await sequelize.query("SELECT * FROM notes", { type: QueryTypes.SELECT })
    console.log(notes)
    sequelize.close()
    // highlight-end
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Unable to connect to the database:', error)
  }
}

main()
```

Executing the application should print as follows:

```js
Executing (default): SELECT * FROM notes
[
  {
    id: 1,
    content: 'Relational databases rule the world',
    important: true,
    date: null
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    content: 'MongoDB is webscale',
    important: false,
    date: null
  }
]
```

Even though Sequelize is an ORM library, which means there is little need to write SQL yourself when using it, we just used [direct SQL](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/raw-queries.html) with the sequelize method [query](https://sequelize.org/master/class/lib/sequelize.js~Sequelize.html#instance-method-query).

Since everything seems to be working, let's change the application into a web application.

```js
require('dotenv').config()
const { Sequelize, QueryTypes } = require('sequelize')
const express = require('express') // highlight-line
const app = express() // highlight-line

const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE_URL, {
  dialectOptions: {
    ssl: {
      require: true,
      rejectUnauthorized: false
    }
  },
});

// highlight-start
app.get('/api/notes', async (req, res) => {
  const notes = await sequelize.query("SELECT * FROM notes", { type: QueryTypes.SELECT })
  res.json(notes)
})

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
})
// highlight-end
```

The application seems to be working. However, let's now switch to using Sequelize instead of SQL as it is intended to be used.

### Model

When using Sequelize, each table in the database is represented by a [model](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-basics.html), which is effectively it's own JavaScript class. Let's now define the model <i>Note</i> corresponding to the table <i>notes</i> for the application by changing the code to the following format:

```js
require('dotenv').config()
const { Sequelize, Model, DataTypes } = require('sequelize') // highlight-line
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE_URL, {
  dialectOptions: {
    ssl: {
      require: true,
      rejectUnauthorized: false
    }
  },
});

// highlight-start
class Note extends Model {}

Note.init({
  id: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    primaryKey: true,
    autoIncrement: true
  },
  content: {
    type: DataTypes.TEXT,
    allowNull: false
  },
  important: {
    type: DataTypes.BOOLEAN
  },
  date: {
    type: DataTypes.DATE
  }
}, {
  sequelize,
  underscored: true,
  timestamps: false,
  modelName: 'note'
})
// highlight-end

app.get('/api/notes', async (req, res) => {
  const notes = await Note.findAll() // highlight-line
  res.json(notes)
})

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
})
```

A few comments on the code. There is nothing very surprising about the <i>Note</i> definition of the model, each column has a type defined, as well as other properties if necessary, such as whether it is the main key of the table. The second parameter in the model definition contains the <i>sequelize</i> attribute as well as other configuration information. We also defined that the table does not have frequently used timestamp columns (created\_at and updated\_at).

We also defined <i>underscored: true</i>, which means that table names are derived from model names as plural [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) versions. Practically this means that, if the name of the model, as in our case is "Note", then the name of the corresponding table is the plural of the name written in a small initial letter, i.e. <i>notes</i>. If, on the other hand, the name of the model would be "two-part", e.g. <i>StudyGroup</i>, then the name of the table would be <i>study_groups</i>. Instead of automatically inferring table names, Sequelize also allows explicitly defining table names.

The same naming policy applies to columns as well. If we had defined that a note is associated with <i>creationYear</i>, i.e. information about the year it was created, we would define it in the model as follows:

```js
Note.init({
  // ...
  creationYear: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
  },
})
```

The name of the corresponding column in the database would be <i>creation_year</i>. In code, reference to the column is always in the same format as in the model, i.e. in "camel case" format.

We have also defined <i>modelName: 'note'</i>, the default "model name" would be capitalized <i>Note</i>. However we want to have a lowercase initial, it will make a few things a bit more convenient going forward.

The database operation is easy to do using the [query interface](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html) provided by models, the method [findAll](https://sequelize.org/master/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#static-method-findAll) works exactly as it is assumed by it's name to work:

```js
app.get('/api/notes', async (req, res) => {
  const notes = await Note.findAll() // highlight-line
  res.json(notes)
})
```

The console tells you that the method call <i>Note.findAll()</i> causes the following query:

```js
Executing (default): SELECT "id", "content", "important", "date" FROM "notes" AS "note";
```

Next, let's implement an endpoint for creating new notes:

```js
app.use(express.json())

// ...

app.post('/api/notes', async (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body)
  const note = await Note.create(req.body)
  res.json(note)
})
```

Creating a new note is done by calling the model's <i>Note</i> method [create](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html#simple-insert-queries) and passing as a parameter an object that defines the values of the columns.

Instead of the <i>create</i> method, it [is also possible](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-instances.html#creating-an-instance) to save to a database using the [build](https://sequelize.org/master/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#static-method-build) method first to create a Model-object from the desired data, and then calling the [save](https://sequelize.org/master/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#instance-method-save) method on it:

```js
const note = Note.build(req.body)
await note.save()
```

Calling the <i>build</i> method does not save the object in the database yet, so it is still possible to edit the object before the actual save event:

```js
const note = Note.build(req.body)
note.important = true // highlight-line
await note.save()
```

For the use case of the example code, the [create](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html#simple-insert-queries) method is better suited, so let's stick to that.

If the object being created is not valid, there is an error message as a result. For example, when trying to create a note without content, the operation fails, and the console reveals the reason to be <i>SequelizeValidationError: notNull Violation Note.content cannot be null</i>:

```
(node:39109) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: SequelizeValidationError: notNull Violation: Note.content cannot be null
    at InstanceValidator._validate (/Users/mluukkai/opetus/fs-psql/node_modules/sequelize/lib/instance-validator.js:78:13)
    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:93:5)
```

Let's add some simple error handling when adding a new note:

```js
app.post('/api/notes', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const note = await Note.create(req.body)
    return res.json(note)
  } catch(error) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error })
  }
})
```

### Tasks 13.1.-13.3.

In the tasks of this section, we will build a blog application backend similar to the tasks in [section 4](/en/gastroenterology), which should be compatible with the frontend in [section 5](/en/genetics) except for error handling. We will also add various features to the backend that the frontend in section 5 will not know how to use.

#### Task 13.1.

Create a GitHub repository for the application and create a new Heroku application for it, as well as a Postgres database. Make sure you are able to establish a connection to the application database.

#### Task 13.2.

On the command-line, create a <i>blogs</i> table for the application with the following columns
- id (unique, incrementing id)
- author (string)
- url (string that cannot be empty)
- title (string that cannot be empty)
- likes (integer with default value zero)

Add at least two blogs to the database.

Save the SQL-commands you used at the root of the application repository in the file called <i>commands.sql</i>

#### Exercise 13.3.

Create functionality in your application, which prints the blogs in the database using the command-line, e.g. as follows:

```bash
$ node cli.js
Executing (default): SELECT * FROM blogs
Dan Abramov: 'On let vs const', 0 likes
Laurenz Albe: 'Gaps in sequences in PostgreSQL', 0 likes
```

<div class="content">

### Creating database tables automatically

Our application now has one unpleasant side, it assumes that a database with exactly the right schema exists, i.e. that the table <i>notes</i> has been created with the appropriate <i>create table</i> command.

Since the program code is being stored on GitHub, it would make sense to also store the commands that create the database in the context of the program code, so that the database schema is definitely the same as what the program code is expecting. Sequelize is actually able to generate a schema automatically from the model definition by using the models method [sync](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-basics.html#model-synchronization).

Let's now destroy the database from the console by entering the following command:

```
drop table notes;
```

The `\d` command reveals that the table has been lost from the database:

```
postgres=# \d
Did not find any relations.
```

The application no longer works.

Let's add the following command to the application immediately after the model <i>Note</i> is defined:

```js
Note.sync()
```

When the application starts, the following is printed on the console:

```
Executing (default): CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "notes" ("id" SERIAL , "content" TEXT NOT NULL, "important" BOOLEAN, "date" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, PRIMARY KEY ("id"));
```

That is, when the application starts, the command <i>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "notes"...</i> is executed which creates the table <i>notes</i> if it does not already exist.

### Other operations

Let's complete the application with a few more operations.

Searching for a single note is possible with the method [findByPk](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-finders.html), because it is retrieved based on the id of the primary key:

```js
app.get('/api/notes/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const note = await Note.findByPk(req.params.id)
  if (note) {
    res.json(note)
  } else {
    res.status(404).end()
  }
})
```

Retrieving a single note causes the following SQL command:

```
Executing (default): SELECT "id", "content", "important", "date" FROM "notes" AS "note" WHERE "note". "id" = '1';
```

If no note is found, the operation returns <i>null</i>, and in this case the relevant status code is given.

Modifying the note is done as follows. Only the modification of the <i>important</i> field is supported, since the application's frontend does not need anything else:

```js
app.put('/api/notes/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const note = await Note.findByPk(req.params.id)
  if (note) {
    note.important = req.body.important
    await note.save()
    res.json(note)
  } else {
    res.status(404).end()
  }
})
```

The object corresponding to the database row is retrieved from the database using the <i>findByPk</i> method, the object is modified and the result is saved by calling the <i>save</i> method of the object corresponding to the database row.

The current code for the application is in its entirety on [GitHub](https://github.com/CliniQuick-hy/urology-notes/tree/urology-1), branch <i>urology-1</i>.

### Printing the objects returned by Sequelize to the console

The JavaScript programmer's most important tool is <i>console.log</i>, whose aggressive use gets even the worst bugs under control. Let's add console printing to the single note path:


```js
app.get('/api/notes/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const note = await Note.findByPk(req.params.id)
  if (note) {
    console.log(note) // highlight-line
    res.json(note)
  } else {
    res.status(404).end()
  }
})
```

We can see that the end result is not exactly what we expected:

```js
note {
  dataValues: {
    id: 1,
    content: 'Notes are attached to a user',
    important: true,
    date: 2021-10-03T15:00:24.582Z,
  },
  _previousDataValues: {
    id: 1,
    content: 'Notes are attached to a user',
    important: true,
    date: 2021-10-03T15:00:24.582Z,
  },
  _changed: Set(0) {},
  _options: {
    isNewRecord: false,
    _schema: null,
    _schemaDelimiter: '',
    raw: true,
    attributes: [ 'id', 'content', 'important', 'date' ]
  },
  isNewRecord: false
}
```

In addition to the note information, all sorts of other things are printed on the console. We can reach the desired result by calling the model-object method [toJSON](https://sequelize.org/master/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#instance-method-toJSON):


```js
app.get('/api/notes/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const note = await Note.findByPk(req.params.id)
  if (note) {
    console.log(note.toJSON()) // highlight-line
    res.json(note)
  } else {
    res.status(404).end()
  }
})
```

Now the result is exactly what we want.

```js
{ id: 1,
  content: 'MongoDB is webscale',
  important: false,
  date: 2021-10-09T13:52:58.693Z }
```

In the case of a collection of objects, the method toJSON does not work directly, the method must be called separately for each object in the collection:

```js
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  const notes = await Note.findAll()

  console.log(notes.map(n=>n.toJSON())) // highlight-line

  res.json(notes)
})
```

The print looks like the following:

```js
[ { id: 1,
    content: 'MongoDB is webscale',
    important: false,
    date: 2021-10-09T13:52:58.693Z },
  { id: 2,
    content: 'Relational databases rule the world',
    important: true,
    date: 2021-10-09T13:53:10.710Z } ]
```

However, perhaps a better solution is to turn the collection into JSON for printing by using the method [JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify):

```js
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  const notes = await Note.findAll()

  console.log(JSON.stringify(notes)) // highlight-line

  res.json(notes)
})
```

This way is better especially if the objects in the collection contain other objects. It is also often useful to format the objects on the screen in a slightly more reader-friendly format. This can be done with the following command:

```json
console.log(JSON.stringify(notes, null, 2))
```

The print looks like the following:

```js
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "content": "MongoDB is webscale",
    "important": false,
    "date": "2021-10-09T13:52:58.693Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "content": "Relational databases rule the world",
    "important": true,
    "date": "2021-10-09T13:53:10.710Z"
  }
]
```
